## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Copy the **[URL](https://github.com/jfpalchak/functional-js-coin-counter.git)** provided for this repository.
2. Open Terminal.
3. Change your working directory to where you'd like to create the cloned directory.
4. In your terminal, type `git clone` and use the copied URL from Step 1. Or, copy the following git command:
   
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jfpalchak/functional-js-coin-counter.git
```

5. Navigate to the root of the newly cloned directory.
6. In your terminal, assuming Node and npm are installed, type the following command to install the project's dependencies found in `package.json`:
   
```bash
$ npm install

7. With the dependencies installed, type the following line in your terminal to build the application using webpack:
   
```bash
$ npm run build
```
  * Additionally, if you wish to:
    1. Lint the JavaScript source code, you can do so by running the following command in the application's root directory: 
    > `$ npm run lint`
